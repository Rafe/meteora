Everything starts as a small idea.

At the beginning, it's just an small thought on the subway back from work.
I am pretty tired during the work, 
so I don't want to cook anything and concidering take some food back.
But I came up with a thought:

> How would I improve the cooking experience,  
> make cooking become a more enjoyable, delightful event for family and friends?

After few months, this idea grows and become the essential question that cookhub trying to solve.
